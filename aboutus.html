<h3>Origins of Biosurf</h3>
<p>Founders and co-owners, brothers Michael and Devon Smith
grew up on the south shore of Long Island New York. There they spent
most of their time in the ocean, surfing big waves and having fun.
However, shredding through surfboards as often as they did, the Smith
brothers found that they were spending thousands of dollars on boards!
After doing a little research they found out that the high cost of
surfboards was due to the rare and expensive wood that is used for
most boards. This means that not only were boards becoming more and
more expensive, but there also wasn't a sustainable source of materials
to create them. Michael and Devon decided that it was time to create
a surfboard that was both affordable and sustainable, so in 2016 they
founded BioSurf, the first completely sustainable surfboard company.
Upon opening there was only one location in Smithtown NY, and stock
was limited to roughly 30 boards of varying sizes. By 2022 the company
has grown exponentially with new stores opening in Long Beach NY, Port
Jefferson NY, and Montauk NY. New stock has also hit the shelves such as
the BioWetsuit which is made completely out of entirely recycled material
and the brand new BioWax: an organic, eco friendly surfboard wax.</p>

<h3>Why Choose Biosurf?</h3>
<h4>-Sustainable Products</h4>
<p>Every one of our products here at Bio Surf are 100% sustainable in<br>
their production and manufacturing. Our boards are made with a recycled<br>
EPS foam exterior and a hemp fiberglass core ensuring the best of both<br>
worlds for weight and maneuverability, while also giving you the peace<br>
of mind of not harming the earth.</p>
<h4>-Affordable Products</h4>
<p>Our boards are sold at rates hundreds of dollars lower than boards<br>
sold by different comanies. With prices ranging from 80-120$ it's hard<br>
for companies who are still using wood to compete. Surfboards of comparable<br>
quality to ours could go for 300$ or 400$, if made out of more expensive<br>
alternatives.</p>
<h4>-Friendly, Local Staff</h4>
<p>Our staff is comprised of some of the friendliest islanders you could<br>
come to know. With many employees being from around the area of their store,<br>
they're happy to help you with tips on local surfing spots and swells.</p>
