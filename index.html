<p>Devon and Michael Smith grew up on the south shore of long island catching waves and rays almost everyday.
They enjoyed boogie boarding and skim boarding growing up, however the ocean sport they really fell in 
love with was surfing. When they turned 16 they each got their first very own surfboards from their 
father. However as years went on and their boards picked up some wear and tear, they were in need of
new boards. Going down to the local surf shop, the smith brothers noticed that every board besides
the plastic training ones ranged between 400$ and 700$. They were appalled! They had no idea their dad
had spent so much money on their passion. Talks with friends turned into business meetings when
they found an affordable way to produce these boards, while also being kinder to the environment.</p>

<p>Every single one of the products cultivated by the Smith brothers was intended to benefit both
the customer and the environment. They hit the ground running selling out of a stand on the beach with
only 5 boards at a time. They would bring them out into the waves as a form of advertisment, and when
people saw how hard they could shred, the 5 boards were gone in no time. Because of the low cost
of production and raw materials, the Smith brothers were able to provide these boards at an affordable 
price to their customers, which has always been a part of the BioSurf mission. Other surfboard companies
may think of their customers as demographics and dollar signs, but the smith brothers think of themselves
as one of the customers. Because they were! Not so long ago.
